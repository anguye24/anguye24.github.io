Ultimately for the front-end we chose to go with React as I was a bit familiar with the library and it just seemed like the best solution at the time because of its performance. A lot of the early stages of development was planning out the project and how it was going to interact with our other APIs and also writing and refactoring code.

The project was finally released into the stores after six months and what was really cool was that our squad was the first to release a React Native app to production.

Some of these features were a bit complex and I had this cool thought of bringing in Apollo Client to talk to our graphql endpoint and also modifying our resolvers to handle our data fetching. This was really awesome as it allowed us to drift away from our Redux boilerplate and gives us advantages to writing more integration tests with the MockProvider which was really beneficial for our QA team and gave us more confidence to deliver the feature. Most recently, React dropped hooks which would shift the paradigm of how we write our React components. I decided to try it out and it was great and all... but there was a problem. Using enzyme to test our custom hooks was really rough so I did some digging and saw that React recommended testing with react-testing-library.
