                  <h3>What is Intrigue Media Solutions?</h3>
                   <p>Intrigue Media is a marketing and digital advertising company located downtown of Guelph, Ontario. Intrigue Media interacts with clients and helps build businesses through the impact of social media, online advertising, website creation and much more. Intrigue has a very fun atmosphere and maintains a pleasurable work environment (there are dogs) yet capable of being serious and getting things done.</p>

                  <h3>What was your experience like working here?</h3>
                  <p>If I could describe the company in just one word, It would be genuine. On my first day of work I remember coming in and everyone was super friendly and welcoming and I thought this was a normal thing that happens because I was new but the funny thing is that they continued to treat me the same way for the next four months. Intrigue Media planned a lot of awesome social events such as monthly pub nights, team lunches, and potlucks. At Intrigue, there was always something to look forward to each week which made the company vibe very fun.</p>

                  <h3>Position</h3>
                  <p>I was hired as Full-stack developer with a major focus on front-end development (React/Redux, jQuery) with some minor back-end development (node.js)</p>
                   
                   
                   <h3>The Early Stage</h3>
                   <p>In my first two months, I spent my time working on new features for company software such as implementing new features, fixing bugs, file minification, and documentation. I generally just had to get really familiar with the code base and become quicker at finishing tickets. The biggest challenge for me was trying to understand all the JavaScript files in the codebase we had for the project but eventually this all became easier as I was going through different tickets on a daily basis.</p>
                   
                   <h3>The Later Stage</h3>
                   <p>The following months picked up when I was given an opportunity to start a project along with the lead developer to build a ticket management system. I spent a week researching and discussing with other team members about the stack we should go with. This was a really big deal for me as I was the lead front-end developer for this project which meant that I would be starting off the base of this project. Ultimately for the front-end we chose to go with React as I was a bit familiar with the library and it just seemed like the best solution at the time because of its performance. A lot of the early stages of development was planning out the project and how it was going to interact with our other APIs and also writing and refactoring code. Starting off the project was a bit pressuring so I spent a lot of my time writing concise and scalabe code with lots of documentation to help ease the next co-op/developer into my role.</p>

            <div class="row item">

               <div class="twelve columns">
                   
                  <h3>First Goal</h3>
                  <p>My first goal this term was to enhance my problem solving skills where I want to solve tickets/problems as efficient as possible and to me this means writing the most minimal amount of lines code possible, having code be reusable, and developing code that is compliant with the current design and flow. I can say by the end of this work term, I am satisfied with what I gained as myself and the other developers at the company were happy with the solutions I came up with.</p>
                   
                   
                   <h3>Second Goal</h3>
                   <p>My second goal was to have a strong understanding of the architecture and design of the company's codebase. I could say that I have accomplished this goal as I am now able to solve any of our tickets probably three times faster than when I first started out so that was a big milestone for me.</p>
                   
                   <h3>Third Goal</h3>
                   <p>My third goal was to improve my verbal skills in terms of explaining my thoughts regarding algorithms and solutions clearly and concisely. It was important to me that I knew how to break down really complex problems/solutions to much simpler terms. This would essentially benefit me and as well the development team if we were able to understand each others thought process when analyzing a problem. When working on the ticket management system project, we had no trouble working on our pieces of code and putting the pieces together later on because everything we planned out had gone smoothly and if something went wrong we were always on the same page and we would group up and discuss other ways to approach our end goal.</p>

                  <p>I have learned so much from my four months at Intrigue Media and it was such a good experience to step away from school and get real work experience. I experienced what it was like to work alongside a team with other developers and to think in such a different perspective based on the strategies of the other team members and how they approach different problems. I was happy to build more on my foundations of web development and create many new connections. Spending so much time at Intrigue Media within the last for months really shapes my idea of the real world and what it is like to work with so many talented individuals. It was a blessing to work here and I am glad I started off my career at Intrigue.</p>

                   <p>I would like to thank my mentor Pranay Sheth for showing me the ropes and helping me build my foundations in software development. Thank you again for being blunt with me and pushing my limits in order for me to truly become a better developer and overall a better person. I also want to thank Dewang, Tawni, Starr, and everyone else at the company, it was awesome working with all of you! I would also like to thank my co-op coordinators, Laura Gatto, Katherine McRoberts as well as my program counsellor Greg Klotz for reviewing my work term report. </p>
